    Attempting to assess and compare various JavaScript client side templating solutions.

# To use

## Client code only

    Simply download the .zip or .tar, unpack.
    Then in the web folder double click on index.html to view in your default browser.

## With Node web service

    Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

    If you don't have it already set up Git [github](http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/)
    
    Either follow the client code only instructions or preferably run:
    
    $ git clone http://github.com/mattyod/Templating

    Navigate to that folder (on the standard command line) and type:
    
    node server.js

    You should then get a message: 'Server running on port 1337'

    Point your browser at http://localhost:1337/
